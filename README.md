# P1.AIVideo

Docker-based multi-agent pipeline that produces short vertical reels (15–60s) featuring a **fully synthetic** white Caucasian human performing lip-synced narration from a text brief.

> **Current status: Phase 2 — no-op multi-agent DAG.**
> Phase 1 (metadata-only intake) plus the full 11-stage DAG running with **no-op** handlers end-to-end: `policy_gate → scriptwriter → voice → face → identity_guard → pre_lipsync_auth → lipsync → editor → qc → export_disclosure_validation → publisher`. A valid job reaches `published`; a rejected job stops at the gate that rejected it. **No model weights, no GPU libraries, no real video/audio/lip-sync — stub MinIO URIs only.** See [`docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md) for the full multi-phase plan.

## Hard guarantees

- **Synthetic-only persona.** Faces and voices are generated; no real-person likeness or voice is ever cloned.
- **Mandatory disclosure.** Every output ships with a visible "AI-generated" overlay, a C2PA manifest, and XMP/EXIF flags.
- **Fully local.** Runs in Docker with GPU support; no paid APIs required at any pipeline stage.
- **No surprise downloads.** Model weights are never auto-fetched at build or first run. See [`docs/runbooks/model-management.md`](docs/runbooks/model-management.md).
- **Adapter-pattern model integrations.** Lip-sync (and other model backends) are swappable via env vars — `LIPSYNC_BACKEND=sadtalker` is the v1 default. See [`docs/architecture/lipsync-adapter.md`](docs/architecture/lipsync-adapter.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Engine** (≥ 24) with **Docker Compose v2**.
- **Linux host** (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended).
- For GPU-enabled services:
  - **NVIDIA proprietary driver** (≥ 550) on the host.
  - **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** so Docker can attach GPUs to containers.
  - Verify with `nvidia-smi` on the host. Setup steps live in [`docs/runbooks/gpu-docker.md`](docs/runbooks/gpu-docker.md).
- **Model weights** live on the host under `./models/` and are bind-mounted into containers. No weights are auto-downloaded; see [`docs/runbooks/model-management.md`](docs/runbooks/model-management.md).
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before bringing up the stack.

## Where to start

1. Read [`docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`](docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md) — full technical plan.
2. Read [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md) — system architecture.
3. Read [`docs/compliance/policy.md`](docs/compliance/policy.md) — what this system will and will not do.
4. Read [`docs/runbooks/dev-setup.md`](docs/runbooks/dev-setup.md) — Phase 1 quickstart (install Python deps, run the integration test).
5. Read [`docs/runbooks/gpu-docker.md`](docs/runbooks/gpu-docker.md) — host setup for NVIDIA + Docker (only needed once Phase 3 ships).
6. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust paths.

## Phase 2 scope (current)

Implemented on top of Phase 1:

- Shared `common/` package — `JobStatus`, `StageStatus`, `StageName`, `ComplianceDecisionType`, `ArtifactRef`, `StageOutput`, `ComplianceTokenClaims`, `DagState`. Both backend and agents depend on this; agents no longer import backend types (DB access coupling is documented; see [`agents/orchestrator/README.md`](agents/orchestrator/README.md)).
- `StageRun` Postgres model recording every DAG-stage execution (`stage_runs` table).
- `DagRunner` (`agents/orchestrator/dag.py`) — hand-rolled state machine reading the canonical stage order from `pipelines/reel_default.yaml`.
- No-op handlers for every stage (`agents/{scriptwriter,voice,face,lipsync,editor,qc,publisher}/handler.py`).
- Compliance Officer:
  - `pre_lipsync_auth` — mints an HMAC-signed `compliance_token` carrying `synthetic_person_confirmed`, `consent_confirmed`, `watermark_required`, `c2pa_required`, `allowed_lipsync_backend`, `issued_at`, `expires_at`, `phase="phase2_noop"`.
  - `identity_guard` — no-op (real CLIP-NN check deferred to Phase 5).
  - `export_disclosure_validation` — no-op (real OCR + C2PA verify deferred to Phase 5).
- LipSync handler **refuses** to run without a valid `compliance_token`.
- `JobStatus` extended with `published`; a valid job transitions `pending_compliance → accepted → published`.
- Integration test (`tests/integration/test_phase2_noop_dag.py`) verifies the full path, all rejection paths, the token, and the metadata-only invariant.

Explicitly **not** in Phase 2:

- No model weights are downloaded.
- No GPU libraries (torch / diffusers / transformers / SadTalker / MuseTalk / Wav2Lip).
- No real video, audio, face, or lip-sync generation — all artifact references are stub MinIO URIs.
- No external paid APIs.
- No LangGraph — the DAG runner is a 200-line hand-rolled state machine. The handler interface is LangGraph-compatible; Phase 3+ can swap in `langgraph` if branching/retry/parallelism warrants the dep.
- Real SadTalker / MuseTalk / Wav2Lip integration is deferred to Phase 3 behind the existing `LipSyncProvider` adapter contract.
